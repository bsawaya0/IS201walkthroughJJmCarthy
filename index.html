<p>J.J. McCarthy’s quarterback career has been a roller coaster of inconsistent throws, questionable reads, and moments
    that make fans wonder if he’s secretly auditioning for a trick shot competition. His deep passes often resemble a
    burrito tossed across the kitchen — unpredictable, messy, and somehow landing nowhere near the target. Defensive
    backs seem to <span class ="redtext"> I am very tired </span> have a personal relationship with his passes, catching them with alarming familiarity. At this rate,
    he might have better luck handling a drive-thru headset than a huddle.</p>

<p class="ugly">Maybe that’s why a career at Taco Bell makes so much sense. J.J. already knows how to hand things off efficiently —
    why not trade footballs for tacos? His ability to improvise under pressure and invent new forms of chaos would fit
    perfectly in a late-night kitchen rush. Picture him calling audibles as he builds a Crunchwrap Supreme: “No, no,
    scrap the sour cream, we’re going double beef!” That kind of bold leadership could make him a legend behind the
    counter.</p>

<p id="pinkparagraph">All jokes aside, life at Taco Bell might be the perfect reset. Instead of reading defenses, he could read orders.
    Instead of listening to boos from the crowd, he’d get cheers from hungry customers receiving extra sauce packets.
    And who knows — maybe he’s been preparing for this transition all along. After all, both football and fast food
    require quick decisions, strong teamwork, and the courage to take bold risks when everything’s on the line.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>reasons why he is so bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>He got benched for 32 year old Carson Wentz</li>
<li>He threw for UNDER 100 YARDS against the packers</li>
<li class="pretty">He holds onto the ball for way too long</li>
<li class="pretty"> He went to michigan where they blaitently stole signs and was in a run first program</li>
<li> 9 </li>
</ul>
